<h2>What is a database?</h2>
A database (DB) is a collection of data that lives for a long time. Many systems fit this definition, for example, a paper-based file system, a notebook, or even a string with knobs for counting.

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a system (software) that provides an interface to database for information storage and retrieval. We are more interested in software systems rather than manual systems because they can do the job more efficiently.
